PCR Thermocycler

Code and other documentation for a really cheap thermocycler built from an Arduino (Ardweeny, actually), peltier junction, and a slice of an aluminum rod with holes drilled into it.   Includes in-tube and in-block thermosensors for calibration.

A python program establishes contact with the 'dump' thermocycler and sends it temperature values according to a file "settings.txt".  There is an opportunity for a better interactive program to produce cycle schedules and write the 'settings' file.
